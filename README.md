- **JavaScript**: is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content,  anything that moves, refreshes, or otherwise changes on your screen without requiring you to manually reload a web page.

- **JavaScript** is either embedded into a web page or else itâ€™s included in a .js file. 

- we can add it in to html page using the tag <script>

     < script type="text/javascript">
      JavaScript code goes here
      < /script>
